    # class: tells python to make a blueprint of an object
    # object: an instance of a class
    # instance: what you get when you tell python to create a class
    # def: define a function in a class
    # self: Inside the functions of a class, self is a variable for the instance being created
    # inheritance: one class inherits traits from another
    # composition: a class that is composed of other classes
    # attribute: A property classes have that are from compositions??
    # is - a: key word used so show inheritance "salmon is-a fish"
    # has -a: keyword used that a class is composed of the things "salmon has-a mouth"
